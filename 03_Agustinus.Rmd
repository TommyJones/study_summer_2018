This is a summary of a blog post on LDA Gibbs sampling and a quick R implmentation of it. The post and Python code can be found here:  [https://wiseodd.github.io/techblog/2017/09/07/lda-gibbs/](https://wiseodd.github.io/techblog/2017/09/07/lda-gibbs/). I have also saved a PDF copy of the page as I found it on 7/25/2018 in /readings/02_lda/other_ref/. 

# Defining the model

# Implemented code

```{r}
### Declare some toy data ----
# document term matrix of word counts
X <- rbind(c(0, 0, 1, 2, 2),
           c(0, 0, 1, 1, 1),
           c(0, 1, 2, 2, 2),
           c(4, 4, 4, 4, 4),
           c(3, 3, 4, 4, 4),
           c(3, 4, 4, 4, 4))

### Initialize 
```
